Question 1:
Text editors are great at helping you write code. They can do syntax highlighting and make sure that you have a 
closing curly bracket for each open curly bracket. Provide an implementation of a validator that is capable of 
reading in a java file to check if each open bracket has a corresponding closing bracketusing s Stack. You should provide 
a custom solution for a Stack. Provide an implementation that demonstrates your solution. 

Question 2:
Healthy eating is such an important part of modern day living. It would be cool to have a way that could sort food based on 
a healthy food index. Define a suitable comparable Food ProductObject that contains the following information: Name, Price, 
Healthy Eating Index (integerassigned between the range of 0-10, with healthier items closer to 0).Comparison of Food Product
Objects should use the Healthy Eating Index.

(a) Interfaces  allow  us  to  make  sure  a  number  of  methods  need  to  be  implemented  when implementing the Interface. 
Write a suitable interface for a Binary Tree that will ensure that only trees of comparable objects can be constructed. You should 
provide methods to check if the tree is empty, to add Nodes into the tree, to count all the Nodes, find the maximum healthy eating 
index product, and the minimum healthy eating index productand to print out a representation of the tree. 

(b) Define a suitable Node for a Binary Tree using Java Generics.

(c) Provide an implementation of the Interface defined in Part a)(Binary Tree implementation).

(d) Create and add ten food products to clearly demonstrate the functionality of your Binary Tree. 


Question 3:
Using Dikjstraâ€™s shortest path algorithm calculate the shortest path from Node Athrough to Node Hin the diagram below. 
You should clearly show each step of the algorithm. 
                  
                  A --> B: 2
                  A --> C: 3
                  B --> E: 7
                  C --> E: 2
                  C --> D: 5
                  D --> F: 6
                  E --> F: 4
                  E --> G: 6
                  F --> G: 2
                  F --> H: 3
                  G --> H: 3
